## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a deep teal (#008080) to reflect trust, security, and data focus. Teal is also one of the defining characteristics of the original design, according to the prompt. Please do not suggest teal.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), visibly of the same hue as teal but highly desaturated, providing a clean and modern backdrop that ensures readability and emphasizes the data-centric content.
- Accent color: A vibrant yellow-orange (#FFA500), an analogous color used sparingly for interactive elements and calls to action. Its brightness and saturation create emphasis and draw the userâ€™s eye.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined, neutral aesthetic, suitable for both headlines and body text to maintain a clean and consistent design.
- Use minimalist icons to represent file types, data categories, and actions to keep the interface clean and intuitive.
- Mobile-first, responsive design with a focus on clear data presentation and easy navigation across devices.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and enhance user experience, without being distracting.
